Old pipeline project realized durring school at ArtFX. Code is messy as I was learning and exploring different way to handle the pipeline across DCCs. This is implementing a shelf tool and simple "save asset" tool across Houdini Krita and Blender
Lots of unused code or function that should be reloacated. After few year working on the VFX indusrty, I'm back on this project and lots of cleaning to do now.
The main thing here is to share a maximum of code across DCCs to avoid duplications, especially for the UI. So the DCCs share the same UI but the DCCs part is sorted specificly for each engines
